# State Generator

In this exercise we continue our development of a generic formal methods framework. In particular, 
	- we will add an implementation of a PassedWaiting-List --- that is a structure that integrates the passed-list and waiting set into one. Your implementation should be added to __fmteach/reach/pw/stud.py__ 
- we will add an algorithm for enumerating all reachable states. This algorithm should use the VM from the exerciseand your newly implemented passed-waiting list. Your implementation should be added to __fmteach/reach/stud.py__.
